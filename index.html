        <li>There are two subspecies of lions found in the wild. The African lion and the Asiatic lion. Asiatic lions are found in a
        small population in India’s Gir Forest. Although both sub-species of lions look very similar, there are some
        differences. Male Asiatic lions tend to have darker, shorter manes compared to African Lions. Additionally, both male
        and female Asiatic lions are smaller than African lions.</li>
